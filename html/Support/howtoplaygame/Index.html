					<h2>Autoplayers</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Slendertubbies has basic bots that acts as players. They allow you to play offline Versus game mode. Here I'll show You how to spawn them and if there is such need how to remove them.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p>Spawning Autoplayes</p>
									<p>In order to spawn AI player you have to make sure that you are running game with Versus game mode enabled. <u>You have to be game host!</u></u></p>
									<p>Press in-game "M" key. You will see this menu.</p>

									<p>Below I'll describe how this menu works.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>This button closes this menu.</li>
										<li>This button adds new Autoplayer.</li>
										<li>This button set AI difficulty to easy.</li>
										<li>This button set AI difficulty to hard.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>You can spawn new Autoplayer by pressing button with number 2.</p>
									<p>There is no limit how many you can spawn them. Maximum amount of bots depends on your hardware spec. I recommend  to play with 4-6 bots.</p>
									<p>Bots has 2 difficult levels. You can specify difficult level by using buttons 3 and 4. On hard difficulty bots know maps better and can spot you from greater distance.</p>
									</li>
									<li><p>Despawning Autoplayes</p>
									<p>Each bot and player has its own row in this menu.</p>
