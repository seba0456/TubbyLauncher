					<h1>How to create match in Slendertubbies</h1>
					<p>This document discusses all the steps of creating a match in Slendertubbies.</p>
					<p>First of all in main menu you have to press "Start Game" button. Now I'll explain how this menu works. We are going to skip networking elements, because I'll explain them in "How to play online" tab. Default game setup will open Singleplayer match.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Game modes<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/gamemode.png"></p><p>Slendertubbies has 2 different game modes. All of them are available in singleplayer and multiplayer modes.<ul><li>Collect<p>This is a classic horror game mode. The player must collect all the custards in order to win the game. The player takes the role of the victim. The time to collect the creams is unlimited. If you are caught by teletubby, you will lose.</p></li><li>Versus<p>Versus game mode is a bit more complicated. The host player takes on the role of Teletubby. The goal of the Teletubby player is to eliminate all 
							survivors before they collect all custards. The survivors must collect all the custards and not let the Teletubbies player touch them. Teletubby will win when all players will be catched. Survivors will win when all custards will be collected. This is strictly a multiplayer game mode and works best with real players. However, you can play it in singleplayer mode with bots. </p></li></ul></p></li>
						<li>Maps<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/maps.png"></p><p>Slendertubbies has 8 different maps. All of them are available in singleplayer and multiplayer modes. Map names are pretty much self-describing.<ul><li>Woods</li><li>Woods (Legacy)</li><li>Maze</li><li>Lake</li><li>Bunker</li>
						<li>Tubbycamp</li><li>Castle</li><li>Swamp Wastelands</li></ul></p><p>I think that best maps are: Bunker, Swamp, Castle and maze.</p></li>
						<li>smount of custards<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/custards.png"></p><p>This is pretty much self-describing. You can specify how many custards will be spawned.</p>
						<p>Default is 10.</p>
						</li>
						<li>Rules<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/rules.png"></p><p>Rules are pretty cool Slendertubbies feature. As you see game has only 3 of them. They can make game harder.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p>Select tubby</Select></p><p>This rule allow you to select teletubby. It controls which Slendertubby will be spawned. In Versus game mode this option will allow player to select versus teletubby. Map Maze has this option is <u>always</u> enabled.</p></li>
								<li><p>Flashlight madness</Select></p><p>This rule ads battery consumption of the game. When this game rule is active, the player's flashlight loses batteries. To keep the flashlight running, you must collect batteries.</p>
								<p>This game rule works in all game modes, and both in singleplayer and multiplayer.</p>
								</li>
								<li><p>Full tubby jacket</Select></p><p>This rule Spawns every possible Slendertubby into game. This game mode makes game really hard.</p>
									<p>This game rule works <u>only in collect</u>, and both in singleplayer and multiplayer.</p>
									</li>
							</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Accept<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/accept.png"></p><p>This button starts game.</p>
								</li>
