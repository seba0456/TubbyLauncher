            <p>As I mentioned earlier on Discord server, work on the Halloween update unfortunately started later than planned. I am sorry to announce that ShadowTubby will most likely not be included in the update. The warehouse map seems to be slightly empty, so I am busy camouflaging the monotony of the environment. 
First I want to finish the map and fix some technical problems.
All in all, a slightly truncated update should appear over the weekend. This is the last update adding new content to Slendertubbies. Thank you for your support in the development of the project.</p>
            <p>I want also like to thank you for downloading my game 40,000 times! 
On itch.io the game has been viewed 100 thousand times!</p>

            <p>New lake map & improvements</p>
            <p>Hello everyone! I want to share with you what brings update 1.3.3.</p>
            <p>There have been many changes in this update. From characters to better textures. This is the last update to my game before Halloween. A link to vote Halloween content has been posted on the devlog on Itch.io. Vote for a future map for Slendertubbies. The patch period for the game I mentioned is slowly coming to an end. After November, I plan to release patches that fix major bugs play. 
</p>
<p>Along with this update, I am also introducing a surprise! The update will add a new version of the Lake map. The old Lake map will share the fate of the old forest.</p>

            <p>Sorry, for the extra patch. While packing the zip archive, a certain file was not packed correctly. I also corrected a small language slip-up in the host menu. I apologize, for the inconvenience.</p>

        <li class="game-update">
            <h3>Update 1.3.1.2</h3>
            <p>I have fixed Swamp Wastelands map. The map is back again!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="game-update">
            <h3>Update 1.3.1.1</h3>
            <p>I have fixed some issues, that was noticed during trailer recording. I have also improved some stuffs and even added new jump scare.</p>
            <p>Slendertubbies:</p>
            <ul class="b">
                <li>Fixed collect game mode jump scare sounds</li>
                <li>Added some barriers to Lake map</li>
                <li>Added AI players counter</li>
                <li>Minor UI changes</li>
                <li>Added new Dooby jump scare sound</li>
                <li>Redesigned jump scare mechanics in versus game mode</li>
                <li>Rebuilt light on all maps</li>
                <li>Decreased flashlight brightness</li>
                <li>Minor post-process changes on map Swamp Wastelands</li>
                <li>Added post-process to map Woods</li>
                <li>Added post-process to map Bunker</li>
                <li>Added rain to map Lake</li>
                <li>Fixed concrete pipe collisions</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>There is nothing special about this new jump scare "mechanics". It used to be auto calculated when character should play jump scare. Now you can do it manually. To play jump scare simply press Left mouse button. These post-processes just change a little bit global colors. </p>
        </li>
        <li class="game-update">
